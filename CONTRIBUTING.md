## Submission Guidelines 📝

### Branch Organization

At The Boring JavaScript Stack, we use the [Gitflow branching model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) where we use a `develop` branch as the main branch for active development. Therefore, all Pull Requests should be directed towards the `develop` branch instead of the `main` branch. This helps us maintain a stable `main` branch while allowing continuous development on the `develop` branch.

### Good First Issue

If you're new to our project, we recommend starting with the [_Good first issue_](https://github.com/sailscastshq/boring-stack/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:%22good+first+issue%22)label. These issues are ideal for getting familiar with the project and making your first contribution. Before starting work, please confirm with the maintainers that the issue is still relevant. Feel free to comment on the issue to express your intention and avoid duplicate efforts.

### Sending a Pull Request

To ensure a smooth review process, please follow these guidelines:

- Fork (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository into your own account.
- In your forked repository, create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch develop`
- Make your changes/fixes.
- Commit your code with a good commit message [using "Conventionalcommits"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin my-branch`
- [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description matching the issue you intend to solve.

> ⚠️IMPORTANT **Note**
>
> ** To ensure a better review experience, we kindly request that you use the following format for the PR title: `[chore]`, `[feat]`, or `[fix]`, followed by a descriptive title. For example, a chore-related change could have a title like `[chore] Update contributing guidelines`. This helps us categorize and understand the nature of the changes made in each PR..**

- Link the issue you have resolved in the Pull Request Template using the following syntax:
- If your Pull Request fixes issue #25, add `Fixes #25` or `Closes #25` to the description.
- If your Pull Request addresses multiple issues, list them using the same syntax (`Fixes #23, Fixes #15`).

This helps us track and automatically close the relevant issue when your Pull Request is merged.

### Commits

We highly encourage the use of conventional commits. Here are some examples:

- feat: Use this when adding a new feature.
- fix: Use this when resolving any issues in the codebase.
- chore: Use this when adding new links/resources or making minor changes.
  (ex. chore: Add 'Privacy Policy' link in footer)
- Please keep your commit messages concise and clear.
- Write commit messages in the present tense, as they represent the current state of the codebase after the changes have been applied.

For additional reference, check out [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
