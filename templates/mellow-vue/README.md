# Mellow

## Introduction

Mellow provides a minimal and simple starting point for building fullstack Sails applications with authentication. Styled with Tailwind, Mellow ships with authentication Sails actions and Vue pages/components that can be easily customized based on your application's needs.

Mellow is powered by Tailwind and Vue and made possible by Inertia.js

Key features of Mellow include:

1. **Sails.js Backend**: Leveraging the power and simplicity of Sails.js for robust server-side operations.
2. **Vue.js Frontend**: Utilizing Vue.js for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
3. **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Employing Tailwind CSS for rapid and flexible UI development with utility-first classes.
4. **Inertia.js Integration**: Bridging the gap between the Sails.js backend and Vue.js frontend, allowing for SPA-like experiences without the complexity of building an API.
5. **Authentication Out-of-the-Box**: Providing pre-built authentication actions and pages that can be easily customized to fit your application's needs.
